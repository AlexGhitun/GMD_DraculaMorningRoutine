# DraculaMorningRoutine

### Game Plan(29/03/2025)

This project is a 2D platformer game that will serve as the final submission for this course. It is inspired by the game "Celeste", but introduces a unique mechanic: the player must avoid staying in sunlight for too long.

The player takes on the role of a vampire navigating various levels in a casual "morning routine" to get a cup of coffee. The core gameplay will focus on traversal challenges, featuring a dash mechanic to help the player cross large gaps. I'm currently deciding whether this dash will simply be a short burst or if it will temporarily transform the player into a bat, allowing for limited flight—though balance is a concern, as I want to avoid making the ability overpowered.

Another planned feature includes mid-air shrines that recharge the dash ability, allowing for extended movement and creative platforming solutions.

So far, I’ve sourced a sprite model for the main character and several environment assets. I've implemented basic movement controls, including left-right facing animations, idle and walking animations, and I’m now working on jump and dash animations, which are still in development.

Development Progress and Challenges:

The most time-consuming part of the process so far has been finding assets that fit the vision of the game. Unity’s 2D tutorial provided a solid foundation for getting started, and I expect it to continue being helpful when creating level environments, the main menu, and the game’s UI.

One of the trickier mechanics to implement will be the dash ability. Not only will it require a fitting animation, but it also needs to be carefully scripted to avoid bugs and to ensure the player isn’t too powerful, which would reduce the game's challenge and enjoyment.

I’m still considering how player failure will be handled—whether through checkpoints, a health system, or restarting the level upon death.

Planned Environments:

The game will feature several thematic levels, including:

-A castle or manor

-A spooky garden or cemetery

-A haunted town leading to the final destination

The final area will contrast sharply with the rest of the game’s darker aesthetic—a bright, cheerful café that signifies the completion of the vampire’s quest for coffee.



Features to implement:

Sun rays and player death if staying too long in them

Player dash/transform

First level environment

Shrines for refreshing the player's ability to dash

UI(should include dash ability availability, timer for level)

Main menu and pause screen

OST/Sound effects to add to the game
